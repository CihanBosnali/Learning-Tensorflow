# Learning-Tensorflow
This repo contains Jupyter Notebooks which I created while learning Tensorflow.

- Lecture 1 is about the meaning and usage of Placeholders, Constants, Operations and Variables in Tensorflow.
- Lecture 2 is about the usage of graphs in Tensorflow.
- Lecture 3 is about the pre-made estimators, feature columns and input function in Tensorflow.
- Lecture 4 is about the pre-made Deep Neural Network Classifiers in Tensorflow.
- Lecture 5 is about the Custom Estimators in Tensorflow.
- Will continue...
